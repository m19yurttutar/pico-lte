# Project Progress Report - Week 1

## Project Overview

This week, I conducted research to gain information on MicroPython, Raspberry Pi Pico, and Sixfab Pico LTE. The goal was to explore the capabilities, applications, and potential integration of these technologies.

## Researches

### MicroPython

MicroPython is a lean implementation of the Python 3 programming language optimized to run on microcontrollers and embedded systems. It provides a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface for interactive programming and supports a subset of Python standard libraries. MicroPython allows developers to write Python code to control hardware components directly, making it suitable for IoT projects and rapid prototyping.

### Raspberry Pi Pico

Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, featuring the RP2040 microcontroller chip. It offers a wide range of GPIO pins, ADC channels, and support for various communication protocols such as UART, SPI, and I2C. Raspberry Pi Pico supports MicroPython as one of its primary programming languages, enabling rapid development and prototyping of embedded projects.

### Sixfab Pico LTE

Sixfab Pico LTE is an expansion board designed to provide LTE connectivity to the Raspberry Pi Pico. It features a Quectel BG96 module for LTE Cat-M1/NB1/EGPRS connectivity, allowing for cellular communication in IoT applications. The expansion board integrates antennas and SIM card slots, making it a compact solution for adding cellular connectivity to Raspberry Pi Pico projects.
